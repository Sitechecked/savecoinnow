## ⚠️ Key Issues

- ❌ **No Regulation or License**  
  Savecoinnow.com is **not listed** or registered with any financial regulatory authority such as the **FCA**, **ASIC**, **CySEC**, or **SEC**.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Lack of Transparency**  
  The website provides no verifiable company details—no business registration, no address, and no real team members.
